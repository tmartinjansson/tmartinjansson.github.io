      <h2>the sum of numbers in a string</h2>
      <p>This is all my understanding, which could be extremely wrong; Reduce is the first argument of the function. you reduce the element currentValue, you remove it from the array, and store it in the accumulator.</p>
      <p>Repeat this with all but the final element. The reduced elements are stored in the accumulator.
      
        <p>Now you have element number 1 to the penultimate number in the accumulator. Add the accumulator with the last currentValue, that we didn't reduce.</p>
        <p>0 is the initialValue, and I haven't been able to figure out exactly why it is needed, or where it is needed. Maybe to get the correct starting point?</p>
      
      <p>It was difficult to manage to get the .html page to display the sum of the Array, but I managed!</p>
      <p>I also managed to code a line to display what the actual values of the sum is!
        <p>these are the values in the Array:</p><p3 id="demo2"></p3>
        <br/><p>Added up:</p> <p3 id="demo"></p3>
