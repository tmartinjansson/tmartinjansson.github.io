    <h3>what's what? Genres and subgenres</h3>

    <p>So you've decided to read books. That's great. Let me help you a little bit.</p>
    <p>There's so many genres. And people who are into certain genres are often hating on other genres. In general, fantasy and science fiction are considered low brow. This is wrong.</p>

    <p>Fantasy and science fiction are often lumped together. Some people are upset by this. I am not.</p>
    
    <p>I don't remember exactly when I started to read, but I remember reading everything young adult (YA) historical fiction I could get a hold of. It was from the school library, and I think it was only stuff by Olof Svedelid. The setting was always Sweden sometime during the 1500s to 1700s.</p>
    <p>I also read all the amazing Bert books written by two swedish dudes. me and the titular character Bert were on the same timeline.
    I finished the last book where he graduates high school during my final year of high school.</p>

    <p>I had a period where i read a lot of crime novels. I don't care for them now. I prefer to read fantasy & sci-fi, certain historical fiction, and non-fiction popular science;  history, politics, stuff like that. Over the years i've also read classics. I'm torn about them. Some are very good and some are just so boring. Some of my favorites are maybe not considered classics.</p>
